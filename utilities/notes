* floats issues: (in header), we have two solution: 
 1. Add `clear` class after directly the classes which floated
 2. Put the floated classes inside another container and style it by give it a `overflow: hidden;`

* Centering element (hero image)
  - position: absolute;
  - top: 50%;
  - left: 50%;
  - transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
