  - container
  - opacity hove
  - general section header and the underline
  - section padding
  - hover effect 1 ( left to right )
  - hover effect 2 ( top to bottom ) 

* floats issues: (in header)
 we have two solution: 
 1. Add `clear` class after directly the classes which floated
 2. Put the floated classes inside another container and style it by give it a `overflow: hidden;`
